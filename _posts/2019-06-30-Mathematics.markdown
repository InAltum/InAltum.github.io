Can a reductionist evolutionary and materialistic account alone explain the development of human intelligence? Human intellect presents a monumental obstacle to a reductionist account. That is because a reductionist and materialistic account fails to explain the development of human intelligence because the capacity of it exceeds any relationship to survival or reproduction. This is not to deny that evolution happened or that evolution had a role in developing human intelligence, but rather arguing that a reductionist account has much more to explain. 


While mathematics began because of practical situations, mathematics rapidly progressed to outstandingly aesthetic and abstract thought of no obvious practical use. Let’s take the example of perfect numbers. A perfect number is a positive integer that is the sum of its divisors, excluding itself. The first perfect number is 6 because its divisors add to 6, 1 + 2 + 3 = 6. Following that we have 28, since 1 + 2 + 4 + 7 + 14 = 28. After that we have 496, which is followed by 8,128. And from 8,128 there is a huge jump until you get to the next perfect number, 33,550,336, which is followed by 8,589,869,056. Up until the present day--even with the most advanced computer processing power--there has only been a total of 39 perfect numbers that have been identified. It is absolutely fascinating intellectual task, nonetheless, it is useless for any practical use. For the ancients, the biggest perfect number known was 8,128. With only four perfect numbers identified, Euclid was able to come up with a proof to identify perfect numbers:
> If as many numbers as we please beginning from a unit are set out continuously in double proportion until the sum of all becomes prime, and if the sum multiplied into the last makes some number, then the product is perfect. [1]


The odd thing is not only that the intellectual ability far exceeds any correlated Darwinian benefit, but also that the entirely abstract work developed by Euclid became fundamental for modern science for the reason that there is a strong correlation between mathematical abstract methods and nature itself. Modern science shows how Newton’s use of Euclid lead to continuous scientific discoveries, which included non-Euclidean geometry and Einstein’s theory of relativity. Hence, the correlation between mathematics and nature is not bound to one level, but it is evident on multiple levels of scientific discoveries. As Pope Benedict stated in his University of Regensburg address:
> ... modern scientific reason with its intrinsically Platonic element bears within itself a question which points beyond itself and beyond the possibilities of its methodology. Modern scientific reason quite simply has to accept the rational structure of matter and the correspondence between our spirit and the prevailing rational structures of nature as a given, on which its methodology has to be based. Yet the question why this has to be so is a real question, and one which has to be remanded by the natural sciences to other modes and planes of thought - to philosophy and theology. [2]

Similarly, Eugene Wigner, 1963 Nobel Prize theoretical physicist winner, noted: 
> It is difficult to avoid the impression that a miracle confronts us here, quite comparable in its striking nature to the miracle that the human mind can string a thousand arguments together without getting itself into contradictions, or to the two miracles of the existence of laws of nature and of the human mind's capacity to divine them. (...) The miracle of the appropriateness of the language of mathematics for the formulation of the laws of physics is a wonderful gift which we neither understand nor deserve. [3]


If nature is in fact randomly developed, then how can the development of the abstract field of mathematics lead to countless scientific discoveries? The answer can’t be that the human intellect developed these abstract capabilities, that far surpasses any prompt benefit for survival, in just 2000 years before its application to understand nature. How is it that nature itself developed millions of years earlier--billions if we take it back to the Big Bang--to such a degree that it is capable of mathematical description, the field which was only developed a couple of thousand years ago? Is it that nature was structured in accordance to elegant abstract mathematical propositions the reason why nature fits so adequately to elegant abstract mathematical propositions? [4]

Nature’s deep intelligibility is the very starting point of science. Such intelligibility defies an entirely evolutionary and materialistic account of the human intellect. Firstly, nature’s profound intelligibility couldn’t be the result of evolution since it precedes the biological evolution of the human intellect. Secondly, the remarkable capacity of the human intellect to grasp nature’s intelligibility, as verified by modern science, tops any reductionist account of the evolution of the human intellect. Hence, the very existence of science requires a non-reductionist account of the human intellect.

### tl;dr 
The current deconstruction of the universities by the SJW ideology was foreshadowed back when Friedrich Nietzsche declared the destruction of the fundamental metaphysics of western culture. Nietzsche pointed out that the consequence of removing the foundation of western culture would be the fragmentation of the idea of value itself... Because if value itself is eliminated then there’s no reason for value hierarchies of virtue — and so the logical outcome would be the move to radical equality. On its way, this movement would wipeout several virtues such as the concept of personal responsibility. 

### Nietzsche: The Tarantulas

SJWs pretend to preach for tolerance but they are actually the most intolerant people out there.

> **Revenge is in thy soul**: wherever thou bitest, there ariseth black scab; with revenge, thy poison maketh the soul giddy!
Thus do I speak unto you in parable, ye who make the soul giddy, ye **preachers of equality!** Tarantulas are ye unto me, and **secretly revengeful ones!**

SJWs always find something to complain about—anything or anyone that stands in their way, such as the “systematic oppression.”

> "Let it be very justice for the world to become full of the storms of our vengeance"—thus do they talk to one another.
**"Vengeance will we use, and insult, against all who are not like us"**—thus do the tarantula-hearts pledge themselves.
**"And 'Will to Equality'—that itself shall henceforth be the name of virtue; and against all that hath power will we raise an outcry!"**

SJWs are full of resentment and prejudice because of their own feelings of inadequacy. SJWs hide behind nice words and love to virtue signal. 

> Ye preachers of equality, the tyrant-frenzy of impotence crieth thus in you for **"equality"**: your most secret tyrant-longings **disguise themselves thus in virtue-words!**
**Fretted conceit and suppressed envy**—perhaps your fathers' conceit and envy: in you break they forth as flame and frenzy of vengeance.

SJWs always complain about how “oppressed” they are even if they are studying at an elite university—they do not see how privileged they are just to be university students. Additionally, SJWs lack gratefulness and have a sense of entitlement.

>Inspired ones they resemble: **but it is not the heart that inspireth them—but vengeance.** And when they become subtle and cold, **it is not spirit, but envy,** that maketh them so.
Their **jealousy** leadeth them also into thinkers' paths; and **this is the sign of their jealousy—they always go too far** (...)
In all their lamentations soundeth vengeance, in all their eulogies is maleficence; and being judge seemeth to them bliss.

SJWs attack those who disagree with them in mobs and with no mercy. 

> But thus do I counsel you, my friends: **distrust all in whom the impulse to punish is powerful!**
They are people of bad race and lineage; out of their countenances peer the hangman and the sleuth-hound.

If you aren’t part of the SJW groupthink, then you are out of luck because they might come after you next—like they have done to those individuals from the Intellectual Dark Web (mostly liberals themselves). 

> **Distrust all those who talk much of their justice! Verily, in their souls not only honey is lacking.
And when they call themselves "the good and just," forget not, that for them to be Pharisees, nothing is lacking but—power!**

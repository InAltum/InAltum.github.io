A short list of book recommendations by my favorite contemporary philosopher Dr. Edward Feser. Most of what I know about philosophy has been because of reading Dr. Feser in my spare time. Additionally, he has an amazing blog [here](http://edwardfeser.blogspot.com) and his personal site is [here](http://www.edwardfeser.com).
